# Covid Prediction
This is an ongoing project on the prediction of Covid continuation, probability of second wave and predicting an approximate end (the lowest minimum possible to be exact). Basically, it is said in mathematics that every infectious disease follows the bell curve. Here lies the question, what follows in terms of Covid-19. In my project, I had a prospective that if I can take both number of infected and number of cured with respect to time and create a curve it may give a bell-shaped curve. By that curve a prediction can be done.
# Result
So far, the curve of affected people with respect to time is generated from dataset. The blue line defines the actual data and orange line defines the curve form whcih can be used as prediction of the covid.

# Update
Unfortunately, I have stopped working on this project. Anyone who want to continue can use the code or communicate with me
