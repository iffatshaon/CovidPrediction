# Covid Prediction
This is an ongoing project on the prediction of Covid continuation, probability of second wave and predicting an approximate end (the lowest minimum possible to be exact). Basically, it is said in mathematics that every infectious disease follows the bell curve. Here lies the question, what follows in terms of Covid-19. In my project, I had a prospective that if I can take both number of infected and number of cured with respect to time and create a curve it may give a bell-shaped curve. By that curve a prediction can be done.
So far, the curve of affected people with respect to time is generated from dataset. The result is shown here:
